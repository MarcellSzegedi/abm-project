## 🚀 &nbsp; Running the Model

* Simple run of the model + animation: run the file src/abm/model.py
* Sensitivity test: run the file src/abm/sensitivity_test.py. You can adjust the code at the very bottom to specify whether to show the number of rioters or injuries.
* Generate plots for the number of rioters/injuries over time: run the file src/abm/visualisation/plot.py. You can adjust the code at the very bottom to specify whether to show the number of rioters or injuries.

## 🤝 &nbsp; Contributing

To contribute to this project, please follow the guidelines below:

#### 🔧 &nbsp; 1. &nbsp; Setup

To synchronize all dependencies for the current version of the project, run:

```bash
uv sync
```
Also, don't forget to set the Python interpreter to the following path:

`.venv/bin/python3`

and activate the virtual environment in your terminal using the following command:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 🌿 &nbsp; 2. &nbsp; Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <BRANCH_GROUP>/<BRANCH_NAME>
```
Use one of the following branch group prefixes based on the nature of your contribution:
- feature
- test
- refactor

Please always use meaningful branch names!

#### ✅ &nbsp; 3. &nbsp; Run Checks Before Commiting

Before committing any changes, run the following command to ensure the code is properly linted, formatted, and that all static type checks pass:

```bash
pre-commit
```

Before committing, also make sure that all tests pass. Upon failure, don't forget to stage the changes using:

```bash
git add .
```
This ensures that your fixes are included in the test run. Otherwise, unstaged changes will be stashed and not considered during testing.

#### 🫛 &nbsp; 4. &nbsp; Merging Changes

The `main` branch of the project is protected by multiple branch rules. All checks — including linting, formatting, unit tests, and static type checks — must pass before a branch can be considered for merging into `main`. Additionally, at least one administrator's approval is required.
